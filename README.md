# CS50x2023-first-project
It's a game programmed by scratch. This is a 2 player game and it's a fight between a rocket and a robot.
You can move the rocket with arrows and move the robot with WSAD.
Also you can get the point by shoting to the other player. you can shot with rocket by pressing "0" and shot with robot by pressing "F".

This project is my first practice in CS50 Harvard 2023. :)))
